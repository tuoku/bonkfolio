# Bonkfolio: Portfolio Tracker & Blockchain Analyzer
## Features
- ### Secure by design
  - Bonkfolio never interacts with your wallets and does not ask for your private keys or seed phrases. Simply scan or paste the public address of any wallet you wish to   track and the app takes care of the rest. 

- ### Wide asset support
  - Bonkfolio supports all
    - BEP-20 tokens on Binance Smart Chain
    - ERC-20 tokens on Ethereum
    - ERC-20 tokens on Avalanche C-Chain

    that are listed on CoinGecko (analytics unavailable for unlisted tokens).

- ### Instant historical data
  - Instead of starting to track your assets from the moment you install the app, the historical and current performance of your portfolio and assets are calculated from     the moment you created your wallet.
  
- ### Deep asset analytics
  - Get in-depth information about your holdings, such as:
    - Weighted average buy price
    - % change from said average
    - (Un)realized profits / losses
    - Reflections earned for reflective tokens
    
- ### Works everywhere
  - Bonkfolio is available on: 
    - Android
    - iOS
    - Web
    - Windows
